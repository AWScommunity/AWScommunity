|**I am Markdown** | *Click* ~~pen~~ pencil icon in this README in new tab|
|  --------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
|to see `whats written to produce this effect` | & more of other markdowns effect in this README|
| In case of numbering & bulleting style markdown|                        |
|1. numbered                                                         |                      |
|2. if just Enter, numbering will simply populate to 2 |                  |
|double enter to destroy it. same with - |                    |
|`Markdowns are supported in` | `not only this README, but also in wikis, gist, issue, PR comments etc` |
| `to find out where its supported` | simply look if `M!` symbol exists at bottom right corner |
| just ignore 100  other fancy BS markdowns | I DONT need it |
| tiny enter, tab can have drastic | effect on markdown, take care |
